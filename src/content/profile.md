Hi, I'm an AI/ML Engineer with experience in research, product development, deployment. I have experience working with **Computer Vision**, **Tabular Data**, **Time-series**, **MLOps** and recently I've gotten into working with **Large Language Models**. My main language is **Python** and I've had experience with **Go** before. I'm currently focusing on broadening my skill to the end-to-end design and implementation of ML Systems, from scalable data pipelines into setting up monitoring and feedback loops. My work experience requires me to regularly learn about new things and even work on problems I have zero experiences with, and I'm used to work in high level of uncertainty.

I'm interested in edge deployment of machine learning, large scale data pipelines, and interesting use cases of machine learning. I'm a fan of technology in general and I like reading up and trying out emerging technologies.
